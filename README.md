# 5'UTR-leaderseq inference pipeline
Introduction
this is a tool for computational inference and analysis of 5’UTR-leader sequence of alleles from immunoglobulin heavy chain genes. 
1. Data pre-procession 
#a barcode-removing appoach of sequencing libraries generated by the 5’-RACE technology 

2. Inference of 5'UTR-leader sequences

3. Quality control
